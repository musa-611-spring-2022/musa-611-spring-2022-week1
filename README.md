## Assignment

### Code Academy

* Sign up for [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* Complete Units 1 through 4 in the Course Academy
  [Introductory Javascript coursework](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
  - Introduction (variables)
  - Responding to conditions (conditionals)
  - Functions (defining behaviors that take some input and maybe return a result)
  - Scope/Scoping rules (where things are defined and where they aren't)

> NOTE: All materials in this course are free by design. Any 'pro' sections
> in code academy are not assigned

- [x] ### Slack

* [Join](https://join.slack.com/t/musa6112022/signup) the class slack organization. If you use your _upenn.edu_ (or _design.upenn.edu_) email address you should be able to get in. If you would like to use a different address (or don't have a design.upenn.edu address) please email me at mjumbe@design.upenn.edu and I will send an invitation.
* Under your settings (top-right corner), go to **Edit profile** and include _at least_ your preferred name, and an image of you.
* Ensure that your **Notification** preferences are set as you would like. I suggest you start with receiving notifications for _All new messages_.

## Exercise

- [x] ### Tools

* A GitHub account
* A git client (e.g., the [`git` CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))
* A code editor with syntax highlighting, such as Atom, VS Code, or Sublime.

### Procedure

1.  Fork this repository to your own GitHub account, and clone it to your computer.
1.  Copy the __start.html_ file in the _introductions/_ folder to create a new called _YOURNAME.html_ (replacing "YOURNAME" with your actual name; for example, I would copy to a file named _mjumbepoe.html_).
1.  Follow the comment instructions inside of your new HTML file.
1.  Commit and push your changes back into your repository on GitHub.
1.  Submit a pull request (PR) back into this repository.

When you submit your pull request, your code will be checked automatically for a few things, including:

- Did you edit the correct file?
- Does your page contain an appropriate title?
- Did you fill out the requested sections correctly?

If all of the tests pass you will see green check marks on the pull request. If any of the tests fail, you should see red X's. You can see what tests fail by clicking on the failed tasks and reading the logs. Edit your copy of the code until all the tests show green checks (_you do not have to re-submit a new PR to get the tests to re-run; as soon as you change your code on GitHub the tests will run_).
