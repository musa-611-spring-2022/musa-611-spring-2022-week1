         represents a latitude and longitude. Find the approximate latitude and
         longitude of your home town (whatever that means to you) and replace
         the values in the array.

         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on
         the page shows your town clearly (you can zoom the map out with lower
         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <h2>My Interests and Experiences</h2>
    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
    <p>
      I studied environmental science and computer science at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, 
      New York and graduated in 2018. Since then, I have worked for the planning and assessment 
      officies in county government maintaining the parcel datasets and producing maps for various 
      projects. I have also volunteered with the URISA GISCorps Disaster PhotoMappers, in which we
      collect images and videos from social media in the immediate hours after a natural disaster and 
      geolocate those images to provide agencies such as FEMA get a better idea of the damages. 
    </p>
   
    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
    <h2>My Hopes for this Course</h2>
    <p>
      I am most excited to increase my depth of experience with web development. In my previous
      coursework, we have focused largely on getting the webpage up and running, rather than the 
      beautification of a webpage. Additionally, I am looking forward to utilizing geospatial data
      and mapping techniques, as those areas were also not the focus of my previous coursework.
