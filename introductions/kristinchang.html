    <!-- 4. Below are two JavaScript variables. The first one is an array that
         represents a latitude and longitude. Find the approximate latitude and
         longitude of your home town (whatever that means to you) and replace
         the values in the array.

         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on
         the page shows your town clearly (you can zoom the map out with lower
         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <h2>My Interests and Experiences</h2>

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
         <p>I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2018 with a Bachelor's in Conservation and 
           Resource Studies and a GIS minor with a focus on landscape ecology. I worked
           as a healthcare consultant for a little over a year where I became well versed with SQL,
           using both Microsoft Access and SQL Studio Server. I spent another year supporting 2020 Census
           Outreach efforts in the SF Bay Area at United Way as a senior data analyst prior to enrolling at UPenn. 
          </p>
          <p>Currently, I am a dual Masters student in the MCP and MUSA departments. My concentration
            is Housing, Community, and Economic Development and I am particularly interested in how we
            measure social vulnerability and how these indices are used in decision-making processes. Additionally,
            I am very passionate about leveraging data analysis in the public sector to better allocate resources
            to historically underserved and underrepresented communities.
          </p>
