         represents a latitude and longitude. Find the approximate latitude and
         longitude of your home town (whatever that means to you) and replace
         the values in the array.

         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on
         the page shows your town clearly (you can zoom the map out with lower
         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <h2>My Interests and Experiences</h2>

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
         <p>I studied Urban Management as an undergraduate, which is an interdisiplinary major mixing urban planning, social public policy and administrative management. My graduation thesis topic is the history of urban planning participation policies in the western world, as you can see, is a totally qualitative study. Honestly I got a really bad outcome and felt pretty embarrased when giving my graduation thesis presentation. It will take me the whole life to forget that scene of suffocation. After that, I decided to give up urban management.</p>
         <p>Thanks for my failure, Now I think I am on the right way. Quantitave analysis and spatial data have impressed me so much. I have totally fasinated by the beauty of urban spatial data and of making decisions by data analysis. After one semester's study of geospatial cloud compute, geospatial data science and public policy analytics, I want to dig into data analysis more in the future and take it as my ideal career.</p>

    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
         <p>I am looking forward to learn basic front-end technologies, including JavaScript and CSS, and more specifically, how to make webs interactive, informative and humanized. Besides, I am also interested in the application of front-end technologies in the urban planning area, maybe it can be a great visualization tool for public participation when planning commuties? In addition, how can knowledge taught in this course be connected to which taught in MUSA509 and other spatial data analysis courses. </p>
         <p>In the end, I am with great pleasure to be in your class again. </p>
