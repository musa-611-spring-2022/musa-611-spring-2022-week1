         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on

         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,

         <p>
           Hello! My name is Jiali Yao. My academic background is urban planning, I had a brief intership in a city planning institute.
           Before this program, I mostly did standard design and planning projects, which are more of finishing a required process than
           addressing urban issues based on profound analysis. I am interested in social equity, especially for people with physical disabilities.
           So I hope I can really improve the living quality of this group in the city using the theories and technics I will learn from MUSA.
         </p>

    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
         <p>
           By learning JavaScript Programming, I hope I could convert my thoughts, observations as well as outcomes to a more visualized, more understandable and more interactive form.
         </p>
