    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,

    <p>
        Hi there!

        I am Xiaoyi, a master student of Urban Spatial Analytics Program at University of Pennsylvania.  <\br>

        I am quite interested in integrating artificial intelligence to urban research such as human behavior, transportation and land-use interactions, and accessibility. <br />

        I have an interdisciplinary background in machine learning, spatial analytics and remote sensing with proficiency in programming.   <br />

        I majored in geology at China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and concentrated on remote sensing. <br />

        Also, I have a strong background in programming and deep learning. Working as a full-time research assistant at a reinforcement learning (RL) lab at Institution of Automation, China Academy of Sciences (CASIA) from 2020 to 2021, I programmed algorithms and simulation systems for engineering projects; and conducted independent research on multi-task coalition games.
        The research experience motivated to continue my PhD study in GeoAI and apply technology into urban issues effectively!         <br />
    </p>

    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
    <p>
        I want to learn how to apply tools such github into our daily work and research.
        Also, I'm quite interested in using JavaScript to create more understandable and interpretable maps for urban studies!
        In addition, I want to learn from Mjumbe how to develop useful tools for data analysis!
    </p>
