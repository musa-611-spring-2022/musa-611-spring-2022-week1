         represents a latitude and longitude. Find the approximate latitude and
         longitude of your home town (whatever that means to you) and replace
         the values in the array.

         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on
         the page shows your town clearly (you can zoom the map out with lower
         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
         <p> I studied Economics with a minor in Sustainable Cities in undergrad at
            Georgia Tech. I then worked for two years as a community development
            consultant for Focus Community Strategies in Atlanta, analyzing
            neighborhood level data to form the Flourishing Neighborhood Index tool.
            I enjoy and aspire to live in various places in the world and learn
            different languages. Next on my list is Quito, Ecuador :)
         </p>
    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
        <p> I hope to learn how to use java to create interactive websites with fun
         animations. I'd like to also improve my skillset to learn how to make
         effective visualizations embedded on the web to help communities understand
         data and tell the story behind the data. Finally, I am interested in
         exploring ways of using java to capture qualitative/ community engagement
         data in addition to quantitative data.
