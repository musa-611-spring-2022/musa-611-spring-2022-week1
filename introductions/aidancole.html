         represents a latitude and longitude. Find the approximate latitude and
         longitude of your home town (whatever that means to you) and replace
         the values in the array.

         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on
         the page shows your town clearly (you can zoom the map out with lower
         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <h2>My Interests and Experiences</h2>

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
         <p>I am straight out of undergraduate from Cornell University, where I
            obtained a B.S. in Environment and Sustainability and minors in Music,
            Business, and Climate Change Studies. After taking a GIS class at
            Cornell, I saw the potential that data science could have in terms of
            making the world a more sustainable place to live in. This one class led me
            here, to the University of Pennsylvania, to pursue a Master's in Urban
            Spatial Analytics and to, ultimately, help cities become more climate-
            adaptive.<p>

    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
         <p>In this course, I hope to learn why JavaScript is the most commonly
             used coding language in the world. What can it do that Python or R can't?
             More specifically, I want to learn more about different ways to visualize data,
             as well as how to build web-based applications.<p>
