         represents a latitude and longitude. Find the approximate latitude and
         longitude of your home town (whatever that means to you) and replace
         the values in the array.

         The second variable is a zoom level. Once you have the latitude and
         longitude of your home town, change the zoom level until the map on
         the page shows your town clearly (you can zoom the map out with lower
         values and zoom the map in with higher values). -->

    <h2>My Interests and Experiences</h2>

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
    <p>
      I studied economics and business, and then went into operations management in Australia after graduation. After that role, I moved to New Zealand and switched into lean and sustainable manufactuing, along with quality assurance operations. However, it was through rudimentary six sigma training that I developed a keen interest in data modeling. This, coupled with insights on how geography impacts sustaibility and 3rd party supply chain, lead to me expanding my education into about spatial analysis and coding.
    </p>

    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
    <p>
      I would like to learn how to make dashboards that are able to automatically update statistics and data from a data source. We learned something similar with panel widgets and dashboards in Python, but it was towards the end of the course and I wish we spent a little more time on that. If we are able to learn how to do it in Javascript, something like web scrapping or API downloading for data, and then present it throgh JavaScript that refreshes real time data.
